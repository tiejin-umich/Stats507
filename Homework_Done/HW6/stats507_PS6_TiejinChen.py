# # Problem Set 6
# ### Question 0
# The link to my repo is:https://github.com/tiejin-umich/Stats507 or
# [here](https://github.com/tiejin-umich/Stats507)
# We put all the homework we done in the folder ```Homework_Done```
# And put all other files in the main folder.

# ### Question 1
# To run the code, it needs data. Hence here we also push data file to the main folder.
# However, We might not push these files.
# Hence we do not store the command line we use to push these files.
# And here is the command line we use:
#
#     #Extract your code as PS2_qs3_tiejin.py.
#     git add PS2_qs3_tiejin.py
#     #Edit my README.md.
#     git add README.md
#     git commit -m "PS6_Q1_first_commit"
#     git push
#     git branch ps4
#     git checkout ps4
#     #Edit the script.
#     git add PS2_qs3_tiejin.py
#     git commit -m "update with PS4's code"
#     git push --set-upstream origin ps4
#     git checkout main
#     git merge ps4
#     git push
#
#

# We have the following link to show:
# 1. in step3, we have the commit:
# https://github.com/tiejin-umich/Stats507/commit/eaa892d7e3f5a0b8272eed1669eaf079244545a0
# 2. in step5, we have the commit:
# https://github.com/tiejin-umich/Stats507/commit/5716954733870aaaac907f6337dcccec801ef8be

# ### Question 2
# The link to file we uploads is:
# https://github.com/tiejin-umich/Stats507/blob/main/pandas_notes/pd_topic_tiejin.py

# ### Question 3
#
# In Question 3, We want to correct PS1 and PS5

# For PS1, we have the following comment:
#
# **Q0: -3 for don't provide both raw and formatted versions**
#
# We want to correct this error, and the commit correction link is:
# https://github.com/tiejin-umich/Stats507/commit/3f510bc817a8ba591de288c0e216e7496f66a9eb

# For PS5, we have not lost our points yet.
# However, we find we forget to polish our writing style
# such as forget to write docstring for a function
# or the length of a line is too long.
# And we will lose our points absolutely. Hence we want to correct PS5 Here.
#
# And the commit correction link is:
# https://github.com/tiejin-umich/Stats507/commit/e5442ab2a144fb09378f28b0327ca5328801d2fd
