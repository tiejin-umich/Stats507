# Stats507

This is the repo of homeworks of Stats507 Data Science with Python, University of Michigan. And this repo is also a part of our homework. The detail requirements can be found [here](https://jbhender.github.io/Stats507/F21/ps/ps6.html). 

Demo_*.XPT are the data from different years of demographic data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). OHXDEN_*.XPT are the data from different years of oral health and dentition data from NHANES. In the script '``PS2_qs3_tiejin.py'``, which is one part of our HW2. We deal with Demo_*.XPT and OHXDEN_8.XPT to get two ```pd.DataFrame``` objects with the variables we need and rename the columns with literate variable names using all lower case and convert each column to an appropriate type for further analysis in later homeworks. Finally, we save these two dataframes as pickle file with name ```demographic data.pickle``` and ```oral health dentition data.pickle```.
